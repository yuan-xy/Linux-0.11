Linux-0.11
==========

The old Linux kernel source ver 0.11 which has been tested under modern Linux,  Mac OSX and Windows.

## 1. Build on Linux

### 1.1. Linux Setup

* a linux distribution: debian , ubuntu and mint are recommended
* some tools: gcc gdb qemu (or bochs)
* a linux-0.11 hardware image file: hdc-0.11.img, please download it from http://www.oldlinux.org, or http://mirror.lzu.edu.cn/os/oldlinux.org/, ant put it in the root directory.
* Now, This version already support gcc 4/5/6/7 series and turn on -O, enjoy it.

### 1.2. hack linux-0.11
```bash
$ make help		// get help
$ make  		// compile
$ make start		// boot it on qemu
$ make debug		// debug it via qemu & gdb, you'd start gdb to connect it.
```
```gdb
$ gdb tools/system
(gdb) target remote :1234
(gdb) b main
(gdb) c
```

## 2. Build on Mac OS X

### 2.1. Mac OS X Setup

* install cross compiler gcc and binutils
* install qemu
* install gdb. you need download the gdb source and compile it to use gdb because port doesn't provide i386-elf-gdb, or you can use the pre-compiled gdb in the tools directory.
* a linux-0.11 hardware image file: hdc-0.11.img

```bash
$ sudo port install qemu
$ sudo port install i386-elf-binutils i386-elf-gcc
```

optional
```bash
$ wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gdb/gdb-7.4.tar.bz2
$ tar -xzvf gdb-7.4.tar.bz2
$ cd gdb-7.4
$ ./configure --target=i386-elf
$ make
```
