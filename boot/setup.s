# setup.s is responsible for getting the system data from the BIOS,
# and putting them into the appropriate places in system memory.
# both setup.s and system has been loaded by the bootblock.
#
# This code asks the bios for memory/disk/other parameters, and
# puts them in a "safe" place: 0x90000-0x901FF, ie where the
# boot-block used to be. It is then up to the protected mode
# system to read them from there before the area is overwritten
# for buffer-blocks.
#

# NOTE! These had better be the same as in bootsect.s!
