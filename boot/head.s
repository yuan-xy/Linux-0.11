 * This routine sets up paging by setting the page bit
 * in cr0. The page tables are set up, identity-mapping
 * the first 16MB. The pager assumes that no illegal
 * addresses are produced (ie >4Mb on a 4Mb machine).
 *
 * NOTE! Although all physical memory should be identity
 * mapped by this routine, only the kernel page functions
 * use the >1Mb addresses directly. All "normal" functions
 * use just the lower 1Mb, or the local data space, which
 * will be mapped to some other place - mm keeps track of
 * that.
 *
 * For those with more memory than 16 Mb - tough luck. I've
 * not got it, why should you :-) The source is here. Change
 * it. (Seriously - it shouldn't be too difficult. Mostly
 * change some constants etc. I left it at 16Mb, as my machine
 * even cannot be extended past that (ok, but it was cheap :-)
 * I've tried to show which constants to change by having
 * some kind of marker at them (search for "16Mb"), but I
 * won't guarantee that's all :-( )
