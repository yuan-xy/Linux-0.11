# SYS_SIZE is the number of clicks (16 bytes) to be loaded.
# 0x3000 is 0x30000 bytes = 196kB, more than enough for current
# versions of linux

#	bootsect.s		(C) 1991 Linus Torvalds
#
# bootsect.s is loaded at 0x7c00 by the bios-startup routines, and moves
# iself out of the way to address 0x90000, and jumps there.
#
# It then loads 'setup' directly after itself (0x90200), and the system
# at 0x10000, using BIOS interrupts. 
#
# NOTE! currently system is at most 8*65536 bytes long. This should be no
# problem, even in the future. I want to keep it simple. This 512 kB
# kernel size should be enough, especially as this doesn't contain the
# buffer cache as in minix
#
# The loader has been made as simple as possible, and continuos
# read errors will result in a unbreakable loop. Reboot by hand. It
# loads pretty fast by getting whole sectors at a time whenever possible.
